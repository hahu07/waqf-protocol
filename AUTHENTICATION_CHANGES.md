# Authentication Changes - Internet Identity Only

## Summary
The authentication system has been updated to use **only Internet Identity** as the authentication method. All passkey authentication options have been removed.

## Changes Made

### 1. AuthSection Component (`src/components/auth/AuthSection.tsx`)
- ✅ Removed passkey imports
- ✅ Removed passkey state management (`isSigningInWithPasskey`)
- ✅ Removed `handleSignInWithPasskey()` function
- ✅ Removed the "OR" divider between auth methods
- ✅ Removed Passkey component from the UI
- ✅ Now shows only Internet Identity button

### 2. Auth Page (`src/app/auth/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Removed "Biometric Passkeys" feature section
- ✅ Updated subtitle: "Secure, anonymous authentication powered by Internet Identity"
- ✅ Changed section heading from "Why Choose Us?" to "Why Internet Identity?"
- ✅ Updated features to focus on Internet Identity benefits:
  - Anonymous Authentication
  - Blockchain Security
  - No passwords required

### 3. User Experience
**Before:**
- Users could choose between Internet Identity OR Passkey authentication
- Multiple authentication options visible

**After:**
- Single, streamlined authentication flow
- Only Internet Identity button displayed
- Cleaner, simpler interface

## Benefits of This Change

1. **Simplified User Experience**: Single authentication method reduces confusion
2. **Blockchain Native**: Internet Identity is built specifically for ICP blockchain
3. **True Anonymity**: No personal information or biometrics stored
4. **Cross-Device**: Internet Identity works across all devices without setup
5. **Decentralized**: Fully decentralized identity management

## Authentication Flow

```
User clicks "Continue with Internet Identity"
         ↓
Redirects to Internet Identity service
         ↓
User authenticates (first time: creates anchor)
         ↓
Returns to Waqf Protocol authenticated
         ↓
User can access their Waqf portfolio
```

## Features Retained
