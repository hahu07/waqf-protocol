# Juno Datastore Setup Guide üöÄ

## Error: "Collection not found"

If you're seeing errors like:
```
Error from Canister: juno.collections.error.not_found (Datastore - waqfs)
```

This means your Juno satellite doesn't have the required collections set up yet.

## Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Access Juno Console
1. Go to **[Juno Console](https://console.juno.build/)**
2. Sign in with your Internet Identity
3. Select your satellite from the dashboard

### Step 2: Create Document Collections

Navigate to **Datastore** ‚Üí Click **"Add Collection"** for each:

#### 1. waqfs Collection
```
Name: waqfs
Type: Documents
Read: managed
Write: managed
Memory: heap
```

#### 2. causes Collection
```
Name: causes
Type: Documents
Read: managed
Write: managed
Memory: heap
```

#### 3. donations Collection
```
Name: donations
Type: Documents
Read: managed
Write: managed
Memory: heap
```

#### 4. allocations Collection
```
Name: allocations
Type: Documents
Read: managed
Write: managed
Memory: heap
```

#### 5. admins Collection
```
Name: admins
Type: Documents
Read: managed
Write: managed
Memory: heap
```

### Step 3: Create Asset Collection

#### 6. cause_images Collection (for file uploads)
```
Name: cause_images
Type: Assets  ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Select "Assets" not "Documents"
Read: public  ‚ö†Ô∏è Public so images can be displayed
Write: managed
Memory: heap
Max size: 10MB (or your preference)
```

### Step 4: Verify Setup

After creating all collections:
1. Refresh your Waqf Protocol app
2. The dashboard should now load without errors
3. You can start creating causes, waqfs, etc.

## Collection Purposes

| Collection | Purpose | Access |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| `waqfs` | Store waqf (endowment) data | Managed (authenticated users) |
| `causes` | Store charitable causes | Managed (admins can manage) |
| `donations` | Track donations/contributions | Managed |
| `allocations` | Store fund allocation records | Managed |
| `admins` | Admin user management | Managed |
| `cause_images` | Store cause images/media | Public read, managed write |

## Access Control Levels

### managed
- Only authenticated users with proper permissions can read/write
- Your app code controls access via Juno's authentication

### public
- Anyone can read (no authentication needed)
- Used for cause_images so images display publicly
- Write still requires authentication

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Permission denied"
**Solution**: Make sure you're logged in and have the correct satellite ID in your `.env` file:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SATELLITE_ID=your-satellite-id-here
```

### Issue: "Collection already exists"
**Solution**: That's fine! Just skip creating that collection.

### Issue: Image upload fails
**Solution**: 
1. Verify `cause_images` is type **Assets** (not Documents)
2. Check that Write permission is set to **managed**
3. Verify you're authenticated when uploading

### Issue: Dashboard still shows error
**Solution**:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`

## Advanced: Collection Rules

For more fine-grained control, you can set custom rules in the Juno console:

### Example: Only admins can create causes
```javascript
// In Juno console, under Collection Rules
{
  "write": {
    "rule": "user.role === 'admin'"
  }
}
```

### Example: Users can only edit their own waqfs
```javascript
{
  "write": {
    "rule": "doc.data.owner === user.key"
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

Once all collections are created:

1. ‚úÖ **Test Admin Dashboard** - Visit `/admin` to see stats
2. ‚úÖ **Create First Cause** - Go to `/admin/causes` and add a cause
3. ‚úÖ **Test Image Upload** - Add an image to a cause description
4. ‚úÖ **Create Waqf** - Go to `/waqf` and create your first waqf

2. Verify your satellite ID in environment variables
3. Make sure you're signed in to Internet Identity
4. Check that all collections are created correctly

**Happy Building! üéâ**

Remember: Collections only need to be created once. After initial setup, your app will work seamlessly!
